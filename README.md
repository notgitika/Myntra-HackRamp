# Myntra-HackerRamp

# PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
In this state of pandemic, e-commerce has been seeing a huge growth of customer base. Despite of the great increase of usage, it has been said that these sites have a very different experience from actually buying the commodities in person. For the fashion e-commerce industry especially, there is a lot of talk regarding how it has not yet replicated the experience of actually shopping physically. The most frequently cited features that aren’t present during shopping via e-commerce are shopping together with friends, ease of shopping due to help from shop staff and getting products after trying them on.

# USE CASE – VIRTUAL ASSISTANT!

 We have come up with a solution that includes the following:
 A Virtual Assistant – 
 The virtual assistant helps customers by guiding them to specific things and if it doesn’t know what the customer is asking for it will lead them to the contact us page of Myntra. The virtual assistant will help solve customer’s basic queries and ask them for their apparel size for better customization of their Myntra feed.
 It will also help them look for specific types of clothes they have in mind. The virtual assistant will also collect data from users such as their sizes and preferences for a more customized shopping experience.

# Solution deep-dive!
 
 We have made the basic framework of the website in Django with all the login , logout and profile features.
 The website also has a chatbot which will only be visible once the consumer logs in. 
 The chatbot which we have referred to as “Myntra bot” is made in Rasa which is open-source. Rasa provides the building blocks for creating virtual assistants. 

# Future Scope:-
 
 We plan to further add orders via the chatbot. In this the customers will choose specific filters in chatbot like size of apparels, etc and the bot will give all the options available on the site. The user will then be able to add the desired product in the cart for purchasing. 
 The bot will also be able to customize the feed of the user according to the customization like colour of product wanted , sizes desired, etc.
 Further we plan to add “Myntra together” in the site. This will help users to direct message their friends and family suggestion of myntra products. 
 It will also allow them to video call their contactsand via Augmented Reality share how the product will look on the person.
