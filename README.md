PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
In this state of pandemic, e-commerce has been seeing a huge growth of customer base. Despite of the great increase of usage, it has been said that these sites have a very different experience from actually buying the commodities in person. For the fashion e-commerce industry especially, there is a lot of talk regarding how it has not yet replicated the experience of actually shopping physically. The most frequently cited features that arenâ€™t present during shopping via e-commerce are shopping together with friends, ease of shopping due to help from shop staff and getting products after trying them on.
